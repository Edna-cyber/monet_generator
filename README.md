# Monet Generator

The goal of this project is to generate 7000+ **monet-style paintings from photos** <br />
(Kaggle challenge: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/gan-getting-started/). <br />
Here are some examples I generated:

## Introduction

The backbone of this project is a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). A GAN consists of a generator and a discriminator who work against each other. The generator attempts to trick the discriminator, while the discriminator tries to accurately classify the real vs. generated images.
